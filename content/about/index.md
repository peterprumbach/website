Hey, welcome to my little website.My name is Peter, I live in Germany and I am currently studying Computer Science to finish my Bachelor of Engineering in early 2023. After that I plan to start directly with a Master in Cybersecurity.

In my free time I like to work with current technologies in the context of IaaC like Ansible or Terraform. I am completing my studies in collaboration with Deutsche Telekom AG, where I can also apply these technologies and deploy them in the Azure cloud.

Feel free to check out my GitHub and LinkedIn account to see what I'm currently working on.
